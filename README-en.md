## 🤔 Why WeAgentChat?

Most existing AI chat tools share the same problem: **they do not remember**. Every conversation feels like starting over with a stranger.

WeAgentChat is different.

| Traditional AI Chat Tools | WeAgentChat |
|:--------------------------|:------------|
| 😶 Every chat starts with a stranger | 🧠 AI friends have **long-term memory** and genuinely know you |
| 🔘 You manually click "New Chat" | ⏱️ Like WeChat, chats are **archived automatically** and continue naturally later |
| 📋 Chat history is just a transcript | 💡 Conversations become **event cards** that surface care at the right moment |
| 🌐 Data lives in the cloud | 🔐 **Local-first**, with all data stored on your own device |
| 🎭 One generic AI for everyone | 👤 Every AI friend has an **independent persona and profile** |
| 🚫 Restricted topics / cloud moderation | 🛡️ **No supervision**, so you can discuss private topics freely |

## 🎯 What WeAgentChat Is, and What It Is Not

To make the vision of **WeAgentChat** clear, here are its boundaries:

### ✅ What it is
- **An AI social simulator with memory**: It recreates a real social atmosphere where AI remembers your personality, preferences, and life details.
- **An extremely private local app**: All memory is stored in a local SQLite database, so your personal life stays on your own machine.
- **A lab for emotionally aware design**: It explores how AI can build genuine emotional resonance through long-term memory and proactive care.

### ❌ What it is not
- **Not a thin wrapper over LLM APIs**: Its core value is the memory system and session management logic, not simple API forwarding.
- **Not a real social network**: There are no real strangers here, only your personal AI social sandbox.
- **Not a pure productivity tool**: It prioritizes continuity and emotional understanding over quickly generating code or documents.

## 🌈 Use Cases: How It Delivers Emotional Value

In a fast-paced world full of judgment, WeAgentChat aims to give you a **low-pressure, high-empathy** digital shelter:

### 🌙 A private late-night safe space
When you take off your daytime mask, the anxieties, secrets, and scattered thoughts you cannot tell real friends can be shared freely with your AI companions. **It is genuinely safe**: the data stays local, it replies instantly, stays on your side, and keeps your privacy intact.

### 📅 Feeling cared about across time
If you casually mention, "I have an important presentation next Monday," then on that Monday morning it may message you: "Hey, good luck with your presentation today. Take a deep breath, you are well prepared." That is not a scheduled reminder. It is **proactive care built on long-term memory**, and the warmth feels real in that moment.

### 🎭 A social comfort zone made for you
Real-world socializing can be exhausting. Here, you can design the circle that fits you best. Maybe it is a relentlessly supportive hype friend, a deeply empathetic therapist, or a sharp-tongued old buddy. **Every conversation can feel emotionally restorative**, helping you regain energy through interaction.

### ⚡ A cross-time gathering of ideas
Bring your AI friends into a group chat and it becomes more than conversation. It becomes a chemistry of perspectives:

*   **A cross-disciplinary think tank**: Let Musk, Einstein, and Jobs brainstorm together, approaching your project from technological limits, physical principles, and design aesthetics. Different kinds of top minds **collaborate** to solve your problem.
*   **A debate arena of opposing views**: On a controversial topic, imagine Lu Xun striking back at a moderate position with fierce writing. Different worldviews **collide and argue** in the group, giving you insights a single perspective could never reach.

## 🔬 Technical Core: How the Dual-Track Memory System Works

WeAgentChat is fundamentally different from a generic AI wrapper. Its core asset is the **Dual-Track Memory** architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User sends message] --> B{Is there an active session?}
    B -- No / Timed out --> C[Create new session and archive old one]
    B -- Yes --> D[Enter main conversation flow]
    
    subgraph "Memory Processing (async in background)"
    C --> E[Extract conversation summary]
    E --> F1[Update global profile Track 1]
    E --> F2[Store event card Track 2]
    end
    
    D --> G{Memory recall enabled?}
    G -- Yes --> H1[Load global profile]
    G -- Yes --> H2[Recall relevant event cards]
    H1 & H2 --> I[Inject into prompt context]
    G -- No --> J[Standard prompt]
    
    I & J --> K[LLM synthesizes response]
    K --> L[Display reply and preserve the chat feel]
```

| Track | Type | Stored Content | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Track 1: Profile** | Global profile | Your personality traits, professional background, social habits | Shapes the AI's tone and overall understanding of you |
| **Track 2: Events** | Event RAG | "Insomnia three months ago", "The meeting you mentioned last Monday" | Enables subtle, timely care during conversation |

- **Local vector indexing**: Uses `sqlite-vec` to build a miniature vector database on your own machine, so your privacy never leaves the device.
- **Proactive recall engine**: Before each reply is generated, a dedicated Recall Agent searches history for the memory fragments most likely to resonate.
